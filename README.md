# l-pp
An esoteric programming language that mimes the
 language of eastern Polish math teachers.

Written in Python 3.

##Current state
Well, doesn't execute yet, but I'm not far from making it work.

##The mechanism
The code is translated to easier-to-interpret thing
(*.plpp file) by parse.py. Currently translates
foo.l-pp file. Then, it's executed by exec.py (currently
nothing happens). 

__The source code (both.py and .l-pp and .pl-pp)
MUST be in UTF-8__. 

##Docs
No docs yet, but you can look into parse.py and foo.l-pp
to get an impression of syntax. Well, as you can 
see it's in Polish and contains Polish letters (those
typical to the Polsih alphabet), so it might be not
so attractive for foreignes, except esolangs geeks.
